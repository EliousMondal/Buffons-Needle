# Buffons-Needle
The three different python codes individually carry out the Buffon's needle simulation by different algorithms. 
myneedleturtle.py is a dynamic simulation carried out with the help of turtle module in python.
This is a portion of my summer project at IISER BHOPAL under Dr.Nirmal Ganguli.
